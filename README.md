I am a Data Engineer and MLOps Engineer who brings a system-level engineering mindset to building clean, scalable, and highly optimized production-grade data systems.

My journey is unique: I spent over 4 years as a Mechanical Design Engineer at Dyson, solving complex physical optimization and system integration challenges. I'm now applying that same 'systems-first' engineering rigor to data infrastructure. This pivot has been a deliberate, multi-year effort, built on a foundation of continuous self-study and hands-on projects, and capped off with a Master's in Computer Science.

I thrive on architecting and optimizing the backend. I'm actively seeking full-time Data Engineer or MLOps Engineer opportunities.

### 🚀 What I'm Passionate About

I'm driven by the challenge of "how to build it right" so that it's clean, scalable, and efficient. I don't just write code; I build systems.

  * **System Optimization & Scalability:** I enjoy working on clean code, scalable architecture, and performance optimization, including concepts like multithreading, multiprocessing, and vectorization.
  * **Backend & Mathematical Logic:** I love coding systems with strong logical or mathematical foundations at their core. I'm currently exploring the bridge between high-level and high-performance languages, such as Python C++ bindings.
  * **Creative Integration:** I excel at integrating, fine-tuning, and customizing existing tools, models, and techniques to solve a specific problem.


### 🛠️ My Tech Stack & Core Competencies

  * **Programming Languages:**
