I am a Data Engineer and MLOps Engineer passionate about building clean, scalable, and highly optimized data systems.

My journey is unique: I spent over 4 years as a Mechanical Design Engineer, solving complex physical system challenges. 
I've now completed a **Master's in Computer Science** to pivot that same engineering discipline—rigorous logic, system-level thinking, and a passion for optimization—to the world of data and machine learning infrastructure.

I thrive on solving difficult backend problems and am actively seeking Data Engineer or MLOps Engineer opportunities.

### 🚀 What I'm Passionate About

I am most comfortable when I am deep in the backend, architecting systems that are both robust and efficient. I don't just write code; I build systems.

  * **System Optimization & Scalability:** My core focus. I enjoy thinking about clean code, scalable architecture, and performance tuning, including concepts like multithreading, multiprocessing, and even Python-C++ bindings.
  * **Backend & Mathematical Logic:** I love coding systems with strong logical or mathematical foundations at their core (e.g., building a Monte Carlo simulator).
  * **Creative Integration:** I excel at integrating, fine-tuning, and customizing existing tools, models, and techniques to solve a specific problem. I'm an adapter and a builder, not a pure UI developer.

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack & Core Competencies

**Note:** You must be truthful here. List what you know. Delete or add as needed.

  * **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, C++ (exploring), Bash
  * **Data Engineering:** Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, dbt, Docker, PostgreSQL, [Add: e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, Data Warehouses like BigQuery/Snowflake]
  * **MLOps & DevOps:** MLflow, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), [Add: e.g., Kubeflow, Jenkins, AWS/GCP/Azure]
  * **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, [Add: e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch]
  * **Concepts:** Data Pipelines (ETL/ELT), System Design, Data Modeling, Microservices, CI/CD for Machine Learning

### 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On

  * Deepening my understanding of distributed systems with [e.g., Apache Spark, Kubernetes].
  * Exploring high-performance computing with Python-C++ bindings (pybind11).
  * Progressing my Japanese language skills from JLPT N4 to **N3**.
  * Building [Mention 1-2 key projects from your GitHub].

### 🌏 My Background

  * **M.Sc. Computer Science** (Mixed-Mode) | *Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)*
  * **B.Eng. Mechanical Engineering** | *[Your University]*
  * **Mechanical Design Engineer** | *Dyson (4+ Years)*
  * **Languages:**
      * 🇬🇧 English (Fluent)
      * 🇨🇳 Mandarin (Native)
      * 🇲🇾 Malay (Fluent)
      * 🇯🇵 Japanese (JLPT N4, progressing to N3)
