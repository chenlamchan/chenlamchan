I am a Data Engineer and MLOps Engineer who brings a system-level engineering mindset to building clean, scalable, and highly optimized production-grade data systems.

My journey is unique: I spent over 4 years as a Mechanical Design Engineer at Dyson, solving complex physical optimization and system integration challenges. I'm now applying that same 'systems-first' engineering rigor to data infrastructure. This pivot has been a deliberate, multi-year effort, built on a foundation of continuous self-study and hands-on projects, and capped off with a Master's in Computer Science. And the journey towards Principal Level continues.

I thrive on architecting and optimizing the backend. I'm actively seeking full-time Data Engineer or MLOps Engineer opportunities.

### 🚀 What I'm Passionate About

I'm driven by the challenge of "how to build it right" so that it's clean, scalable, and efficient. I don't just write code; I build systems.

  * **System Optimization & Scalability:** I enjoy working on clean code, scalable architecture, and performance optimization, including concepts like multithreading, multiprocessing, and vectorization.
  * **Backend & Mathematical Logic:** I love coding systems with strong logical or mathematical foundations at their core. I'm currently exploring the bridge between high-level and high-performance languages, such as Python Rust bindings.
  * **Creative Integration:** I excel at integrating, fine-tuning, and customizing existing tools, models, and techniques to solve a specific problem.


### 🛠️ My Tech Stack & Core Competencies

  * **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, Rust (WIP), Go(WIP), Scala(WIP)
  * **Data Engineering:** Apache Kafka, Apache Spark
  * **Databases & Storage:** Apache Iceberg (Data Lakehouse), Clickhouse (OLAP), MinIO (Object)
  * **Visualization & BI:** Apache Superset
  * **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker
  * **MLOps & DevOps:** 
  * **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pytorch
  * **Concepts:** Event Streaming and Processing, Data Pipelines (ETL/ELT), System Design, Data Modeling

### 📫 Let's Connect

I am dedicated to continuous improvement and lifelong learning. If you have any feedback, suggestions for enhancement, or innovative ideas for any of my projects, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out directly. Your insights are invaluable as I strive to refine my skills and code.
Nevertheless, I am always open to discussing technology, data system, optimization, or interesting opportunities.
